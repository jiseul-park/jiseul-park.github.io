## Title
Electrically cured ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) embedded with carbon nanotubes for field casting and crack sensing
## Abstract
The effects of incorporating carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC), thereby forming UHPC/CNT composites, were investigated in terms of electrical curing efficiency, [mechanical properties](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/mechanical-property "Learn more about mechanical properties from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), and crack sensing capability. The addition of CNTs significantly decreased the electrical resistivity of the UHPC, allowing effective electrical curing at low voltage; improved mechanical properties through bridging, pore filling, and calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) stiffening effects; and favorably influenced the deflection hardening and multiple [cracking behavior](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/cracking-behavior "Learn more about cracking behavior from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") under flexural stress. Furthermore, the developed UHPC/CNT composites subjected to compressive or flexural stress showed significant crack sensing capability due to the obtained low electrical resistivity. A dramatic [fractional change](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/fractional-change "Learn more about fractional change from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in the resistivity (FCR) of the UHPC/CNT composites can represent the failure under compression or first cracking under [flexure](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/flexure "Learn more about flexure from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Therefore, it was experimentally verified that the UHPC/CNT composites can extend the applications of UHPC materials especially for on-site casting and structural crack sensors for UHPC-based structures.
