## Title
Numerical analysis on stability of cylindrical structures in 3D printing process
## Abstract
In additive manufacturing of concrete, the prediction of critical failure length is one of the key steps for optimizing various process parameters, such as printing speed, geometrical features of printed objects, and time-dependent material characteristics. This paper presents a numerical model for analyzing the buckling capacity of a straight cylindrical wall during additive manufacturing. The failure mechanisms, namely elastic buckling and plastic collapse, are compared to construct the design graphs representing the critical length as functions of wall geometries, material properties, and horizontal nozzle velocity. Here, the global buckling length based on the beam theory generally overestimates the mechanical performance of printed columns in the practical range of printing parameters. In contrast, the local buckling length based on the plate and shell theory give a lower bound with different wavenumbers in the circumferential direction. As the geometrical parameters change, the critical failure mode transition occurs. The model and failure mechanism maps can be used to explore the influence of process parameters on the structural stability of printing objects, which will give directions to optimization of construction time and wall configuration.
