## Abstract
Dispersion of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is the critical factor affecting the performance of [nanocomposites](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nanocomposites "Learn more about nanocomposites from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"); however, the quality of CNT dispersion could be indirectly understood due to the limitations of evaluation methods of the dispersion. This study aimed to visualize the macroscopic spatial distribution of CNTs in an _as-is_ hardened [cement matrix](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/cement-matrix "Learn more about cement matrix from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") for the quantification of dispersion. Using a confocal Raman microspectroscopy equipped with an [optical microscope](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optical-microscope "Learn more about optical microscope from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), the major phases in cement, hydrates, and CNTs were identified from their characteristic Raman signals to construct the definitive phase map. The dispersion efficiency and heterogeneity were defined to quantify the fraction of CNT-affected region and the unevenness of CNT distribution. The experimental results demonstrate the importance of a well-dispersed stable state in CNT suspension and suggest that it is possible to evaluate the effectiveness of [ultrasonication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/ultrasonication "Learn more about ultrasonication from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") with [superplasticizers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/superplasticizer "Learn more about superplasticizers from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") that have been frequently adopted as a dispersion technique in hardened [cement composites](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/cement-composite "Learn more about cement composites from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages").
