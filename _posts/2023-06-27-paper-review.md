## Introduction
- Micro-Raman spectroscopy?
  - intensity and wavenumber is related to the structure, mass of constituent, atoms, interatomic forces
  - interatomic forces depend on small changes in bond length and angles
  - the structure and composition of mineral can be investigated by using micro-Raman
- Mineral of interest: "Olivine"
	- orthorhombic Pbnm structure
	- complete solid solution between the Fe and Mg end members
	- Mg# = Mg molar ratio w.r.t Mg+Fe
	- terrestrial olivines contains Mg# 60-95




## Some questions to solve
- Q: excitation laser wavelength와 Raman shift는 관련이 있는가?
- A: 이론적으로 excitation laser wavelength는 intensity와만 관련이 있음


## Writing
- words
	- chiefly: 주로, 무엇보다 = mainly
	- obviates: ~을 불필요하게 하다 = do not require, need
	>	Second, it obviates the need for vacuum, polishing, and carbon-coating for analysis, and is therefore convenient for analyzing ﬁne precious samples.
	- igneous: 화성의
	- doublet, singlet
	- ca: about의 줄임말, 이탤릭체, 자주 사용하는 표현인지는 모르겠음
		- However, the precisions of Mg# determined by their equations are *ca* ±3.
	- a precision of ±1 = 비슷하게 given number 도 사용하능한건가?
	>	For petrological and geochemical arguments of mantle and igneous ultramaﬁc/maﬁc rocks, a precision of ±1 in Mg# units is required.
		
	>	we recommend the use of Eqn (1) for peak 2 when Mg# >60, which enables us to determine Mg# of given number ±1.
	- in-situ ~ real-time 비슷하게 쓰일 수 있을 듯

	>The wavenumber of peak 5 was most sensitive to Mg#, followed by peaks 2, 1, and 4;
	>
	>The more sensitive nature of peak 5 compared to peak 1 and 2 is explained as follows: the systematic peak shifts with Mg# are caused chieﬂy by a decreaseintheSi–Ocovalentinteractionandtheinter-tetrahedral O–O Coulomb repulsion induced by substitution of cations in the octahedral sites, and contribution of the O–O Coulomb repulsion within the SiO 4tetrahedra is insigniﬁcant because the change in intertetrahedral O–O distances is negligibly small.
