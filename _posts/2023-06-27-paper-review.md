## Introduction
- Micro-Raman spectroscopy?
  - intensity and wavenumber is related to the structure, mass of constituent, atoms, interatomic forces
	- interatomic forces depend on small changes in bond length and angles
  - the structure and composition of mineral can be investigated by using micro-Raman
- Mineral of interest: "Olivine"
	- orthorhombic Pbnm structure
	- complete solid solution between the Fe and Mg end members
	- Mg# = Mg molar ratio w.r.t Mg+Fe
	- terrestrial olivines contains Mg# 60-95


## Some questions to solve
Q: excitation laser wavelength와 Raman shift는 관련이 있는가?

A: 이론적으로 excitation laser wavelength는 intensity와만 관련이 있음
